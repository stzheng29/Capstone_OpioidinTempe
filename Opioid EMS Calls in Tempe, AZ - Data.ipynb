Death rate due to opioid overdoes in Arizona increased from 8.2 per 100,000 individuals in 2012 to 13.5 per 100,000 individuals in 2017. Arizona Department of Health Services has declared a public health emergency in 2017 to address the dramatic increase in opioid death in Arizona.      \n       \nTempe is a city to the east of Phoenix in Arizona and is the location of the Arizona State University. It has a population of 185,038 in 2017 according to the Census Bureau Report. The city has been collecting all emergency medical services calls related to possible opioid abuse, and the dataset is available to public.      \n      \nIn this study, I explored the possible opioid abuse in the city of Tempe by zip codes. The same zip codes were then used to query Foursquare location data for popular venues in that area. Different areas were then compared by feature of venues and the probability of possible opioid abuse. The result may shed light on the features of the environment and possible opioid abuse.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Part 2.
